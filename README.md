# CompTIA Security+ Study Notes

This repository contains markdown study notes for individuals who prefer text-based study materials. It is still a work in progress and will be updated over time.

### Overview of Markdown Notes

In the markdown notes, you can find:

- **Practical Examples**
- **Short Explanations**
- **Long Explanations**

Short explanations are designed for quick reviews, while long explanations cater to those learning the material for the first time or wishing to dive deeper. Most practical examples stem from real-world work problems, and all markdown notes are supported by diagrams where necessary.
