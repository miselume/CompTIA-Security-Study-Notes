# 💤 Lazy Notes - Security Controls

Welcome to *lazy notes* for security controls. Lazy notes designed to help lazy people like me remember the essentials fast.

### 1. What Are Security Controls?

Security controls are measures used to secure systems.
They’re grouped by what they *do* (their functionality).

### Most Important 4 (PCDD)

1. **P – Preventive:** Stop future attacks.
2. **C – Corrective:** Respond and fix damage.
3. **D – Directive:** Give guidance and instructions.
4. **D – Detective:** Spot and alert on incidents.

All of these usually fall under *technical controls* - protections implemented through technology.

### Other Controls (Quick Reminders)

* **Managerial:** Define the rules and oversee security.
* **Directive:** Tell people *how to follow* those rules.
* **Operational:** Day-to-day security work.
* **Compensating:** Backup or improvised controls when main ones aren’t possible.
* **Physical:** Locks, guards, access cards; protect the actual stuff.
* **Deterrent:** Scare attackers off (e.g., warning signs).
