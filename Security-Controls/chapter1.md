# Security Controls

**Security controls** are measures put in place to protect an organization's information and systems.
They’re categorized based on their functionality, basically *what kind of protection or role they provide*.

## Categories of Security Controls

### **1. Technical Controls**

* Implemented through technology to protect systems and information.
* Think of these as the “inside-the-system” or “techy” stuff; firewalls, encryption, authentication systems, intrusion detection systems, etc.
* These are essential for automating and enforcing security protections at a technical level.

### **2. Preventive Controls**

* Aim to **prevent** security incidents *before* they happen.
* Examples: antivirus software, access control lists, security policies, multi-factor authentication.
* Their main goal is to reduce the likelihood of attacks or unauthorized actions.

### **3. Managerial Controls**

* High-level, non-technical controls focusing on **policies, planning, and oversight**.
* Examples: risk assessments, security governance, audits, compliance management.
* These controls help define the organization’s security strategy and posture.

### **4. Deterrent Controls**

* Designed to **discourage** potential attackers or violations.
* Examples: warning signs (“Area under surveillance”), disciplinary policies, or banners warning about monitoring.
* The idea is to make attackers *think twice* before trying anything.

### **5. Operational Controls**

* Related to **day-to-day security operations and management**.
* Examples: incident response procedures, training employees, handling backups, and maintaining logs.
* Basically, these are the “daily grind” of keeping security running smoothly.

### **6. Detective Controls**

* Used to **identify and alert** on security incidents *after* they occur.
* Examples: system logs, intrusion detection systems, monitoring tools, and audits.
* Think of these like a “detective” they don’t stop crimes, but they tell you when one’s happened.

### **7. Physical Controls**

* Protect **physical assets** from unauthorized access or damage.
* Examples: locks, security guards, CCTV cameras, access cards, and physical barriers.
* These are crucial since a physical breach can often lead to a total compromise.

### **8. Corrective Controls**

* **Respond to and mitigate** the impact of an incident after it’s detected.
* Examples: security patches, restoring backups, incident response actions, and system recovery.
* They focus on fixing issues and preventing further damage.

### **9. Compensating Controls**

* **Alternative measures** used when a primary control isn’t feasible.
* Example: if you can’t use biometric access due to cost, you might use strong password policies and logging instead.
* Basically, it’s about improvising; covering a gap with something else that achieves a similar effect.

### **10. Directive Controls**

* Provide **guidance and expectations** for personnel behavior.
* Examples: security awareness training, policies, codes of conduct, and standard operating procedures.
* They’re like a guidebook for “what to do and how to do it” to stay compliant and secure.
* It's easy to confuse it with managerial controls. To make it easy to remember you can think like this:
    1. Managerial controls = define the rules
    2. Directive controls = tell people how to follow the rules

## Commonly Essential Controls

Some controls are absolutely foundational for most organizations:

* **Technical controls** → essential for automating and enforcing system-level protections.
* **Preventive controls** → essential to stop issues before they happen.
* **Managerial controls** → essential for defining overall security strategy and responsibilities.
* **Physical controls** → essential for preventing unauthorized physical access.

It’s good to remember PCDD; which stands for Preventive, Corrective, Directive, and Detective; as the main risk control techniques.

## Examples in Practice

1. A company might use:

   * **Firewalls (Technical)**
   * **Monthly risk assessments (Managerial)**
   * **Warning signs on premises (Deterrent)**
     → Together, they create a multi-layered defense strategy.

2. After a breach:

   * The company applies **Corrective controls** (e.g., patches, recovery actions)
   * Uses **Detective controls** (e.g., monitoring, alerts) to watch for further issues.

3. After unauthorized access to data servers:

   * The company increases budget for **security guards** and **physical locks** (Physical)
   * Implements **Directive controls** to give clear security instructions to staff.
